## Description

My weekly challenge for week 1. This challenge is a code refactoring challenge which is where the starter code needs to be updated and consoildated without altering its functions and visual design. The task specifically is  analyzing the html and see which divs can be altered into semantic html tags and the consolidate any css codes that are similar to each other.
